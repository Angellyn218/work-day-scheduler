# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

During the work day, a person can be assigned a number of tasks to complete. Any person can use this website to stay organized and on top of their tasks. This website keeps track of the current day, current time, and will change colors based on the hour. Additionally, the events will be saved even when the page is reloaded.

Building this website taught me a lot more about jquery, moment.js, and bootstrap which were all instrumental tools that I used to build this website. Building this website taught me how to search through documentation, and use what I need to make my website more functional.

This will keep the event stored even when the page is reloaded. If the button is not pressed, the event will not be saved when the page reloads.
